<h1>HIRE ME</h1>
I like to earn some money on the side by doing some coding. If you are looking for a web-dev, someone to make Blender add-ons or just to do any kind of Python scripting I am the one you're looking for.
If you are interested please contact me at kwikandkwak@gmail.com or send me a message on Reddit.

  <p class="display-3">This site</p>
  <p>
  I made this site myself using django. Django is a very popular framework for webdevelopment that uses Python as it's main programming language. That's the reason I chose for that approach as I have a lot of experience with Python. I use bootstrap for the design(and also crispy-forms). As you probably noticed by the website's URL this page is hosted on Heroku. It's fantastic as it is 100% free but that of course has some downsides. The most annoying are the fact that loading the page takes a very long time and that I am also unable to let the server sent you the videos so you can play them in your browser. That's because heroku doesn't like sending files that big for a webpage. Luckily it is possible to download the videos. You can always just watch the video on Reddit.

  <p class="display-3">Minecraft renders</p>
  I like to do these and post them to Reddit but rendering is not my main focus, it is just something I do when I'm a bit bored with coding. That's also why there are months between some posts. Nevertheless, my posts get very appreciated on the r/Minecraft. Feel free to use the download buttons on this page store them locally. The only thing I expect from you is that you ask for permission if you would like to use on a website or something.

  <p class="display-3">Blender add-ons</p>
  <p>
  I made 3 Blender add-ons that have 3 very different uses. The add-ons are made with Python using the Blender's advanced Python API. I made these mostly for personal use because they speed up my workflow in Blender a lot and because I just really like to work with the Blender API. More information on the add-ons can be found on their seperate page on this website.
